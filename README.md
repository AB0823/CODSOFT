**To Do App**
This Python code creates a simple To-Do List Manager GUI application using Tkinter. It allows users to add tasks, delete selected tasks or all tasks, and displays the tasks in a list format. 
The tasks are stored in an SQLite database. The code ensures basic error handling and maintains a clean user interface with clear separation of input fields, buttons, and task display area.
