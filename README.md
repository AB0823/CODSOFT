**To Do App**

This Python code creates a simple To-Do List Manager GUI application using Tkinter. It allows users to add tasks, delete selected tasks or all tasks, and displays the tasks in a list format. 
The tasks are stored in an SQLite database. The code ensures basic error handling and maintains a clean user interface with clear separation of input fields, buttons, and task display area.


**Generate Password**

This code presents a graphical user interface (GUI) for generating passwords. Here's a brief description of the code:

**Interface Setup**: The code sets up a Tkinter window with labels and entry fields for the user to input their name and desired password length. Another label displays the generated password.

**Password Generation**: Upon clicking the "Generate Password" button, a password of the specified length is randomly generated using a combination of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and punctuation.

**User Interaction**: The user can click the "Accept" button to display a message indicating that their input has been accepted. Additionally, the "Reset" button clears all the input fields.
